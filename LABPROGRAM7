//*Write a program that demonstrates handling of exceptions
in inheritance tree. Create a base class called “Father” and
derived class called “Son” which extends the base class. In
Father class, implement a constructor which takes the age
and throws the exception WrongAge( ) when the input
age<0. In Son class, implement a constructor that uses both
father and son’s age and throws an exception if son’s age is
>=father’s age*//
